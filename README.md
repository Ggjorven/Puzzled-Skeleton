# Puzzled-Skeleton

Dungeon Escape is a small C# WPF game where the player, a skeleton who was once human, must navigate through a series of dungeon chambers to find a way out. Along the journey, the skeleton discovers a photo from its past, which restores it to its human form. The game is built using C# with WPF for the interface and visuals.
